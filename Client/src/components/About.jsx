            Affiniti Hair Salon started as a small suite in Whittier in 2019 but
            with much work and determination we moved to a bigger location in
            Uptown Whittier and decided to expand and open the doors to talented
            hairstylists who would share the same vision. Affiniti means the
            liking or love for something and thatâ€™s exactly what we have. We
            love doing hair, making the clients feel confident and we wanted to
            share that with our clients. Affiniti Hair Salon specializes in making the client feel more
            confident about a look that suits them. We believe that there are
            numerous of wonderful colors out there, but our speciality is to do
            a color that is right for you. We believe everyone has the perfect
            looks that suit their skin tone, eye color, career, and lifestyle.
